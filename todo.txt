x - not started
c - started not done
v - done
to do:
    v localStorage for current run (so you cant just refresh and cuck it all)
    x build leaderboard that shows your stats after game ends
    v implement RIT login to associate statistics/scores with a person
        - currently it can get UID. this is done? maybe?
    x build firebase db to store statistics
        - each individual person has their own collection
        - each one has a spot for current day, and for overall scores
            - current day one is checked on first load, if the days don't match it wipes the currentDay (implement different maybe)
        - store names with usernames (this will just be hard coded in the db with everyone's rit emails which im hoping we can pull from RIT login)
    x build leaderboard.html page to show statistics for: 
        - how everyone did today
        - your personal stats
        - everyone's comparative stats (points system- 6 points for first word, 1 point for last, etc.?)
    x when you get a word wrong you cant delete it

less important but would be nice:
    v convert window.alerts to something nice like on actual wordle (animation for word not real, etc.)
        - word not real - done
        - word correct - done
    x allow people to use keyboard (only matters if you're playing on pc like a weirdo)
    v change keyboard colors
